Create a class for a local African currency. This class should have variables that hold a unit value for the currency, another for the *$\\frac{1}{100}$* unit (*ie* cents in many countries) and their corresponding currency units (*ie* Franc CFA). For instance, given an amount 200.50 FCFA, var1 = 200, var2 = 50, var3 = FCFA and var4 = centimes (unit for the *$\\frac{1}{100}th$*).\n","- The constructor should take both base currency unit and that of the *$\\frac{1}{100}th$*(should default to \"None\")\n","- The variables should be made inaccessible outside the class. Instead, add methods that allows reading and setting values appriopriately inside the class. \n","- Further, implement methods that allows *adding* and *subtracting* different amounts of the same currency together as well as *mutliplying* the money by integers. You must also have the `exchange_currencies` method which accepts the exchange rate and between the two currencies before applying the afforementioned operations.\n","- Printing the object should return the value as type *double* followed by the unit of currency. ie 200.20 FCFA\n","- Speak to about 5 of your colleagues or tutors from different countries in class and ask them for their local currencies.
