PyTorch Tensors are more powerfull as they support some additional enhancements which make them unique: \n","\n","Apart from CPU, they can be loaded on the GPU for faster computations using the `.device` attribute. A similarlly important feature of them is that when setting `.requires_grad = True` pytorch autograd engine start forming a graph that tracks every operation applied on them to calculate the gradients using the same idea of computaional graphs we talked about it previously.\n","\n","Pytorch Autograd is an engine to calculate derivatives. It records a graph of all the operations performed on a gradient enabled tensor and creates an acyclic graph called the dynamic computational graph. The leaves of this graph are input tensors and the roots are output tensors. Gradients are calculated by tracing the graph from the root to the leaf and multiplying every gradient in the way using the chain rule.\n","\n","if you still don't get it I recommend this video:
